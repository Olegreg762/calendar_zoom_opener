# Calendar Zoom Link Opener <br>

Clicking to open a Zoom Link so you can attend a meeting from your calendar can be tedious. <br>
So I created this script that will search a calendar file to find any zoom links and will open them for you.<br>
<br>
This was built using Python 3.7 using only built in libraries. If you already have Python 3.7+ running this shouldn't be an issue.<br>
One limitation of this script is that the time to open the link is set manually in the `zoom_time` variable and will no adjust to the time of <br> the zoom. This is something I would like to change in the future.
